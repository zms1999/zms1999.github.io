I am a third year Ph.D. student, advised by [Prof. Jidong Zhai](https://pacman.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~zjd/).
I received my BSc in Computer Science and Technology in 2022 from Tsinghua University.

My research interests include machine learning systems, graph mining systems and high performance computing.
Currently, I am focused on Mixture-of-Expert model optimization.

I was a member of [Tsinghua Student Cluster Competition team](https://sc.team/).

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
